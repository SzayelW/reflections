What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git directory, where data commit are storages and log, its necessary to user git commands on our project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a middle area where files to be commited are added, it doesn'y affect the files in the actual directory.
